## Notes

- Admin mode is based on a token stored in `localStorage`.
- This project uses a **mock backend** provided during training (`http://localhost:5678/api/...`).
- If deploying, a real backend would be required for full functionality.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add better form validation and error messages
- Deploy the project using GitHub Pages or Netlify
- Replace mock API with real backend and database
- Enhance accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Improve mobile responsiveness
